# jsonform v2

Hi there! 

This is jsonform. A quick and easy way of creating forms, validating field inputs and processing the data all from simplistic JSON (or a JS object).

`V2` is the new complete rewrite of the jsonform library for adding a bunch of new features and dropping jQuery.

`V2` is currently a work in progress as we work on adding features and functionality compared to the `V1`.

## `V2` new features

* no more jQuery
* custom field & theme API
* more APIs for interacting with and controlling the form
* better integration on the server-side (such as submit to POST endpoint and retrieve form from GET endpoint)
* improving the flexibility & design of forms with the default Bootstrap 4 theme
* adding support for Bootstrap 5

... and more! If you have an idea, feel free to suggest it in the GitHub issues.

Thanks! <3
